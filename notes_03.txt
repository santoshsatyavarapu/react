Lets create script to run server in package.json.
In scripsts we can write whatevere we need to do at starting.
"start":"parcel index.html","build":parcel build index.html"   start and build can be any key names.

Now to start any script we can write npm run scriptName like  npm run start

React element is not a html element it is a object.

reactDom element converts react element to html when we do render


className not class in jsx.
JSX is just syntax,and babel converts jsx syntex to react element.

To write in multiple lines jsx need to be placed in brackets.


React component:Everything is a component in react
Two types:
class based components//old way
functional components//New way 

Functional component:
Can be triggered by <ComponentName />  or ComponentName() or <ComponentName> </ComponentName> all  are same

Component composition means combining tow components.


You can write javascript in jsx by adding {}. 

So if {} in this we used an api and if it is attacked jsx will escape. The attack is know as cross side scripting
